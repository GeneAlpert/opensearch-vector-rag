# Vector search with Amazon OpenSearch Service

In this workshop you'll get hands on with Amazon OpenSearch Service vector capabilities to build Retrieval Augmented Generation(RAG) based Gen AI Shopping advisor. First you will learn how to build a multimodal search with OpenSearch Service and understand the value proposition compared to the basic lexical search. Then, you will learn how to build conversational search solution using multimodal search to augment Large Language Model (LLM) prompt with relevant context from both text and images. In this first part, you will use Amazon SageMaker Notebook to run through the lab code.
